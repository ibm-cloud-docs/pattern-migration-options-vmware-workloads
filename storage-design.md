# Storage Considerations

{: \#storage-design}

## Storage Requirements

The storage requirements for the lift and shift VMware to IBM Cloud VMware solution focus on the following

Fasttrack a datacentre exit strategy with move VMware workloads to cloud.

Replace on-premises VMware storage solution.

Optimize VMware storage operational expense (OpEx) and Capital expenditure (CapEx)costs.

For Mission and Business critical workloads deliver 99.99% Availability and RPO near zero.

Provide replacement for on-premises tape backup storage.

Provide secure automated backup service.

| Fasttrack datacentre exit and move to cloud                                         | The migration of the VMware datastores from on-premise to IBM Cloud is covered by the migration program. Two methods can be assessed: cold migration of virtual instances or live migration of virtual instances using VMware storage vmotion. Most migration programs will use cold migration as VMware Storage vmotion has many requirements.                                                                                                                                                              |
