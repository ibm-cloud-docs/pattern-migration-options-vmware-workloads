# Compute design

{: \#compute-design}

The following table summarizes the compute design considerations when solutioning lift and shift VMware on-premise workloads to IBM Cloud VMware Solutions.

**Requirements**

-   No change to applications in move to cloud
-   Fasttrack a datacenter exit strategy
-   Right size VMware VCF licensed cores to business usage
-   Provide high performance and low latency
-   For Mission and Business critical workloads deliver 99.99% Availability and RPO near zero.
-   Optimise VMware operational costs (compliance and platform lifecycle costs)

**Business innovation requirements**

-   Enable AI inferencing in production business processes
-   Provide encoder / decoder capabilities for GenAI business process innovation development
-   Provide mission and business critical Kubernetes platform for modernized cloud native applications

**Design Considerations**

|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Retain VMware Virtualization                      | Rehost and replatform are avoided, with a retain of VMware as the virtualization platform allowing for the same VMware components used in onpremise or collocated facilities. Clients can maintain the same VMware software stack with a lift-and-shift of both the management and workload virtual servers to IBM Cloud VMware Solutions with no application or software changes. |
| Choosing IBM CloudÂ® for VMware Solutions offering | The level of VMware management and automation that the customer wants to transfer to IBM Cloud. Level of flexibility to retain same VMWare design, management plane, automation. Performance and low latency requirement for workload using 4th generation Intel Xeon.                                                                                                             |
| Right Sizing VMware VCF License core              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| High Performance and low latency                  | High performance provided by latest Intel Xeon currently Gen 4. Low latency provided by using network driver accelerators between ESX server and TOR switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Optimise VMware operational costs                 | Use IBM Cloud delivery (automation and service delivery) Review IBM Cloud VCFaaS for  Single Tenant VCFaaS Mission and business Critical Production workloads Multi-Tenant VCFaaS for NONPROD notably Test/Dev                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Migration tooling                                 | VMware HCX (for VCF) allows for retention of the virtual machine IP addresses and Virtual Machine replication features such as vmotion and storage vmotion allow for live migration of Virtual instances from onPremise or collocated datacenters to IBM Cloud VCF offering.                                                                                                       |
