| Retain VMware Virtualization                      | Avoid re-host and re-platform application modernization patterns which only serve to delay datacentre exit strategy. Retaining of VMware as the virtualization platform so that the VMware components used in on-premise or collocated facilities can be re-used in the IBM Cloud. Clients can maintain the same VMware software stack with a lift-and-shift of both the management and workload virtual servers to IBM Cloud VMware Solutions with no application or software changes. VMWare operational skills and investment in automation assets can be maintained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Choosing IBM Cloud® for VMware Solutions offering | Two key criteria can be used to choose the IBM Cloud for VMware Solution Offering The level of VMware management and automation that the customer wants to transfer to IBM Cloud or operating flexibility required to retain the same VMware design, management plane and automation. The level of VMware hypervisor compute and network accelerators from IBM Cloud IaaS leveraged by the design to maximise virtual instance densification, CPU performance and high network bandwidth requirements (\>=100 Gb/s) for workloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Right Sizing VMware VCF License core              | It is important to properly size the new server environment to minimize the cost of VMware licensing changes. Start with an RVTools report from the current on premise VMware server environment. On premise infrastructure is often sized to handle peak workloads. The report will show the number of vCPU, RAM and storage assigned to each virtual machine. For RAM & storage both the amount provisioned for the VM and the amount in use when the report was run will be displayed. The amount needed in the cloud should be closer to the in-use numbers. Consider the model numbers of the VMware ESXi servers on premise and note that the server models in IBM Cloud likely are newer, with significantly faster processors and more cores. Typically, fewer vCPU will be needed in the new environment which will lower VMware licensing cost. Cloud compute, memory and storage can be scaled rapidly so sizing can be aggressive initially in the cloud landing zone and scaled up as needed. Scaling or adding additional bare metal servers using the IBM VMware Cloud Foundation VPC or VCFaaS offerings can be within an hour. Many VMware environments, such as development and test workloads do not need to run all day long. It is recommended to shift non-production to hourly consumption on IBM Cloud VMware as a Service (VMWaaS) for 20-30% price decrease in assets and licenses. Many businesses are conservative when establishing a ratio of CPU to vCPU with ratios like 2:1 or 4:1 common. With the more powerful Sapphire Rapids processors available on IBM Cloud, these ratios can be increased dramatically to 6:1 or even 12:1 in some cases.  |

| Additional tooling to right size on-premise x86   | Many mission and production critical x86 environments have ecosystem of platforms including VMware, Bare Metal, custom appliances, can benefit from a TCO or FinOps review. IBM Cloud use a TCO analysis by Akasia. Aptio can be used for FinOps. <br> One IBM tool that can be leveraged to right-size your VMware environment is Turbonomic. Turbonomic employs a dynamic approach to rightsizing resources, assuring optimal performance while minimizing cost. Turbonomic can size your virtual machines’ vCPU and vMemory to match observed demand and peaks and can automate rightsizing in real time to meet demand. IBM also offers a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis for businesses. This analysis uses FinOps software from Akasia to compare the costs of running VMWare workloads on premise and major cloud providers including IBM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Re-platform Virtual Machine to cloud native hypervisor | Consider re-configuration of virtual server in choosing the right workload to re-platform. Requirement for re-design of Network configuration (including potential IP address change) can lead to complexity and delays in re-platform. Deployment, scaling, patching automation built up with VMware API will need to be developed with Terraform and Ansible. Additional IBM Cloud services will be required to provide comparable VMware capabilities. To implement a migration from On-premise VMware to IBM Cloud Virtual Server Instance, the RackWare Management Module (RMM) migration solution provides a seamless virtual-to-virtual replatforming for VMware virtual machine (VM) to IBM Cloud® virtual server instance migration. It allows the adoption of existing capabilities of IBM Cloud. |
