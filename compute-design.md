| Retain VMware Virtualization                      | Retaining of VMware as the x86 virtualization platform allows for the same VMware components and operational skills and automation assets can be re-used in the IBM Cloud. Lift and shift migration method for both the management and workload VMware compute clusters allows for no application changes when moving to IBM Cloud. \n Other options include: \n * Re-hosting to alternate hypervisor such as KVM or HyperV, can have a high risk of application changes related to infrastructure configuration such as IP addresses. Additionally automation assets for the virtualisation platform stack such as security patching hypervisor layer will need to be developed. \n * Re-platform the VMWare x86 virtual servers to KubeVirt containers, couples the move to Cloud to the application modernization program has a risk of higher percentile virtual instances remaining and delay to the datacenter exit strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Choosing IBM CloudÂ® for VMware Solutions offering | Two key criteria can be used to choose the IBM Cloud for VMware Solution Offering The level of VMware management and automation that the customer wants to transfer to IBM Cloud or operating flexibility required to retain the same VMware design, management plane and automation. The level of VMware hypervisor compute and network accelerators from IBM Cloud IaaS leveraged by the design to maximise virtual instance densification, CPU performance and high network bandwidth requirements (\>=100 Gb/s) for workloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Right Sizing VMware VCF License core              | It is important to properly size the new server environment to minimize the cost of VMware licensing changes. Start with an RVTools report from the current on premise VMware server environment. On premise infrastructure is often sized to handle peak workloads. The report will show the number of vCPU, RAM and storage assigned to each virtual machine. For RAM & storage both the amount provisioned for the VM and the amount in use when the report was run will be displayed. The amount needed in the cloud should be closer to the in-use numbers. Consider the model numbers of the VMware ESXi servers on premise and note that the server models in IBM Cloud likely are newer, with significantly faster processors and more cores. Typically, fewer vCPU will be needed in the new environment which will lower VMware licensing cost. Cloud compute, memory and storage can be scaled rapidly so sizing can be aggressive initially in the cloud landing zone and scaled up as needed. Scaling or adding additional bare metal servers using the IBM VMware Cloud Foundation VPC or VCFaaS offerings can be within an hour. Many VMware environments, such as development and test workloads do not need to run all day long. It is recommended to shift non-production to hourly consumption on IBM Cloud VMware as a Service (VMWaaS) for 20-30% price decrease in assets and licenses. Many businesses are conservative when establishing a ratio of CPU to vCPU with ratios like 2:1 or 4:1 common. With the more powerful Sapphire Rapids processors available on IBM Cloud, these ratios can be increased dramatically to 6:1 or even 12:1 in some cases. |
| Optimise VMware operational costs                 | In lift and shift from on-premise VMware to IBM Cloud VMware Solutions review current VMware management and automation assets and assess Moving to IBM Cloud VMware automation for deploying, patching and upgrading VMware Cloud Foundation components. Leveraging IBM Cloud VMware as a Service typically for Test and Development environments so as to reduce dependency on inhouse VMware skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Additional tooling to right size on-premise x86   | Many mission and production critical x86 environments have ecosystem of platforms including VMware, Bare Metal, custom appliances, can benefit from a TCO or FinOps review. IBM Cloud use a TCO analysis by Akasia. One IBM tool that can be leveraged to right-size your VMware environment is Turbonomic. Turbonomic employs a dynamic approach to rightsizing resources, assuring optimal performance while minimizing cost. Turbonomic can size your virtual machinesâ vCPU and vMemory to match observed demand and peaks and can automate rightsizing in real time to meet demand. IBM also offers a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis for businesses. This analysis uses FinOps software from Akasia to compare the costs of running VMWare workloads on premise and major cloud providers including nIBM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Migration tooling                                 | The virtual machine migration method will depend on the VMware on IBM Cloud flavour, the size of the environment and the functionallities needed. When migrating to VMware VCF as a service on IBM Cloud,the recommended method is to use VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA). VCDA enables migration from traditional on premises VMware environments or from other VMware as a Service on IBM Cloud/VMware Cloud Director environments.\n For all other VMware VCF on IBM Cloud flavours, the main options are VMware HCX, Zerto, Veeam and primary Io. VMware HCX allows to preserve the migrated virtual machines IP addresses, creating easily reversible migration waves and extending the network from on premises to the cloud (which allows for "progressive" migrations).\n Zerto and Veeam are more traditional replication solutions, simpler to implement. Primary Io provides a DRaaS service that can also be used to migrate VMware workloads from on premise to VCF on Classic or on VPC in IBM Cloud.|

| Re-platform x86 Virtual Instance to IBM cloud native hypervisor                         | Consider level of re-configuration in virtual instance when choosing the workload to re-platform. Requirement for re-design of Network configuration (including potential IP address change) can lead to complexity and delays in re-platforming. Deployment, scaling, patching automation application and operating system built up with VMware API will need to be re-developed with Terraform and Ansible scripts. Additional IBM Cloud services can be required to provide comparable VMware capabilities. IBM Cloud provides migration tooling from On-premise VMware to IBM Cloud Virtual Server Instance, the RackWare Management Module (RMM) migration solution provides a seamless virtual-to-virtual replatforming for VMware virtual machine (VM) to IBM CloudÂ® virtual server instance migration. It allows the adoption of existing capabilities of IBM Cloud.
