| Retain VMware Virtualization                      | Re-host and Re-platform application modernization patterns are avoided to delay datacentre exit strategy. Retain of VMware as the virtualization platform allows for the same VMware components used in on-premise or collocated facilities. Clients can maintain the same VMware software stack with a lift-and-shift of both the management and workload virtual servers to IBM Cloud VMware Solutions with no application or software changes. VMWare operational skills and automation are maintained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Right Sizing VMware VCF License core              | It is important to properly size the new server environment in order to minimize the cost of VMware licensing changes. Start with an RVTools report from the current on premise server environment. On premise infrastructure is often sized to handle peak workloads. The report will show the number of vCPU, RAM and storage assigned to each virtual machine. For RAM & storage both the amount provisioned for the VM and the amount in use when the report was run will be displayed; the amount needed in the cloud should be closer to the in use numbers. Take into account the model numbers of the ESXi servers on premise and note that the server models in IBM Cloud likely are newer, with significantly faster processors and more cores. Therefore, fewer vCPU will be needed in the new environment which will lower VMware licensing cost. Cloud compute, memory and storage can be scaled rapidly so sizing can be aggressive initially in the cloud landing zone and scaled up as needed. Many VMware environments, such as development and test workloads do not need to run all day long. It is recommended to shift non-production to an hourly-consumption on IBM Cloud VMware as a Service (VMWaaS) for 20-30% price decrease in assets and licenses. Many businesses are conservative when establishing a ratio of CPU to vCPU with ratios like 2:1 or 4:1 common. With the more powerful Sapphire Rapids processors available on IBM Cloud, these ratios can be increased dramatically to 8:1 or even 12:1 in some cases. One IBM tool that can be leveraged to right-size your VMware environment is Turbonomic. Turbonomic employs a dynamic approach to rightsizing resources, assuring optimal performance while minimizing cost. Turbonomic can size your virtual machines’ vCPU and vMemory to match observed demand and peaks and can automate rightsizing in real time to meet demand. |

## Right Sizing VMware VCF License core

It is important to properly size the new server environment in order to minimize the cost of VMware licensing changes.

Start with an RVTools report from the current on premise server environment. On premise infrastructure is often sized to handle peak workloads. The report will show the number of vCPU, RAM and storage assigned to each virtual machine. For RAM & storage both the amount provisioned for the VM and the amount in use when the report was run will be displayed; the amount needed in the cloud should be closer to the in use numbers. Take into account the model numbers of the ESXi servers on premise and note that the server models in IBM Cloud likely are newer, with significantly faster processors and more cores.

Therefore, fewer vCPU will be needed in the new environment which will lower VMware licensing cost. Cloud compute, memory and storage can be scaled rapidly so sizing can be aggressive initially in the cloud landing zone and scaled up as needed.

Many VMware environments, such as development and test workloads do not need to run all day long. It is recommended to shift non-production to an hourly-consumption on IBM Cloud VMware as a Service (VMWaaS) for 20-30% price decrease in assets and licenses.

Many businesses are conservative when establishing a ratio of CPU to vCPU with ratios like 2:1 or 4:1 common. With the more powerful Sapphire Rapids processors available on IBM Cloud, these ratios can be increased dramatically to 8:1 or even 12:1 in some cases.
