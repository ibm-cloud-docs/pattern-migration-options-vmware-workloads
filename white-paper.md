# Lift and shift VMware on-premises to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}
{: #whitepaper}

Over the past two decades, many enterprises developed the VMware Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) as the dominant virtualization platform for hosting x86 production and business critical workloads in on-premises or colocated data center facilities. VMware has a 44.8% market share in x86 virtualization platform technologies, per Statista.

In parallel with maintaining the production platform on-premises, and as a society outcome of the global pandemic, businesses are requesting an acceleration of the digital transformation to a cloud native enterprise platform - in effect, a recognition that the compute platform has become the business, with hosted digital products generating the revenue. For the business, the digital compute platform needs to be trusted, highly available, secure, scalable, with agile integration to the digital products user experience and feature set evolution.

This white paper describes the business requirements, solution considerations, and migration approaches to move the on-premises x86 VMware virtualization compute, storage, and network to {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}}. The production workload environments (PROD, UAT, SIT, DEV) are moved to {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} by using the lift and shift method with no change to the business applications.

## On-premises business challenges
{: #onpremisebusinesschallenges}

Business challenges are leading clients to reevaluate the x86 VMware virtualization on-premises or colocated platform:

- Licensing cost increases for VMware virtualization: Businesses are looking to minimize the impact of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) bundled pricing changes effective 1 May 2024 and mitigate potential future VCF subscription cost increases. As part of their acquisition of VMware, Broadcom introduced a new unified subscription based licensing model for VMware software. This new model that is resulted in businesses needing to change their then perpetual VMware software licenses into two bundles: VMware Cloud Foundation or VMware vSphere Foundation Essential.
- High operational costs to maintain an on-premises or colocation data center facility: Significant operating expenditure OpEx is incurred to maintain compliance and security of the VMware infrastructure resources across the x86 bare metal servers, storage, and network devices. OpEx costs include:
  - Managing costly regulatory, industry certifications and audits.
  - Time consuming server and VMware Cloud Foundation component security patching updates.
- High capital expenditure CapEx costs to grow or adapt the on-premises facility to adapt to business requirements include:
  - Slow, multi-week, new VMware ESXi server provisioning for new capacity requirements.
  - Slow, multi-week, increase in VMware ESXi server memory RAM or additional storage request execution.
  - Shorter server refresh cycles to avoid costly extended warranties.
- Cybersecurity: Businesses are faced with growing cybersecurity threats and data breaches requiring their CISO to adopt the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST cybersecurity best practices and apply adequate preventive and recovery security measures to their systems. There are many challenges in deploying the zero trust security model across hybrid cloud.
- Deliver improved platform availability, resiliency, security, performance, and scaling business requirements due to the accelerated shift to a digital economy observed post pandemic. The business compute platform that once needed to be available 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, now are required to be available 24x7 with overall platform availability of 99.99%+. As a cloud provider, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} can provide higher availability, security, performance, at lower costs than businesses can typically do on-premises.
- Slow innovation and deployment of new modernized cloud native applications or services: Initial application modernization to the cloud native operating system Linux, and the container platform Kubernetes, is very successful for web internet facing applications but has struggled particularly with the modernization of Windows.Net Framework applications, leading to delayed application modernization to cloud native development programs.
- Delayed implementation of a data center exit business mandate.
- Maintaining VMware automation assets while developing Infrastructure as Code assets across the hybrid cloud platform.

| Retain VMware virtualization                      | Retaining VMware as the x86 virtualization platform allows for the same VMware components and operational skills and automation assets to be reused in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. No application changes are needed when moving to {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full_notm}} by using the lift and shift migration method for VMware clusters.  \n Other options include: \n * Re-hosting to an alternate hypervisor such as KVM or Microsoft Hyper-V, which can require application changes related to the infrastructure configuration such as IP addresses. Additionally, automation assets for the virtualized platform stack such as security patching for the hypervisor layer must be developed. \n *  Re-platform the VMWare x86 virtual servers to KubeVirt containers coupling the move to cloud with the application modernization program. This introduces risk of virtual instances remaining which can delay data center exit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Choosing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} for VMware Solutions offering | The choice of the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full_notm}} is based on the following criteria: \n * The level of flexibility the customer requires in the VMWare Cloud Foundation landing zone architecture and deployment automation. \n *  The level of transfer VMware Cloud Foundation skills and automation to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} for the Day 2 management. \n * The level of network performance and bandwidth required with the VMware Cloud Foundation on VPC offering the highest level of performance and integration with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} native Virtual Private Cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Sizing the VMware Cloud Foundation license cores              | It is important to properly size the new server environment to minimize the cost of VMware licensing changes. Start with an RVTools report from the current on-premises VMware server environment. On-premises infrastructure is often sized to handle peak workloads. The report shows the number of vCPU, RAM, and storage assigned to each virtual machine. For RAM and storage, both the amount provisioned for the virtual machine and the amount in use when the report was run is displayed. The amount that's needed in the cloud should be closer to the in-use numbers. Consider the model numbers of the VMware ESXi servers on-premises and note that the server models in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} likely are newer, with significantly faster processors and more cores. Typically, fewer vCPU is needed in the new environment which lowers the VMware licensing cost. Cloud compute, memory, and storage can be scaled rapidly so sizing can be aggressive initially in the cloud landing zone and scaled up as needed. Scaling or adding additional bare metal servers using the VMware Cloud Foundation for VPC or {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_notm}} offerings can be done within an hour. Many VMware environments, such as development and test workloads, don't need to run all day. It is recommended to shift non-production to hourly consumption to IBM Cloud {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} for 20-30% price decrease in assets and licenses. Many businesses are conservative when establishing a ratio of CPU to vCPU with ratios like 2:1 or 4:1 being common. With the more powerful Intel Sapphire Rapids, Generation 4, processors available on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, these ratios can be increased dramatically to 6:1 or even 12:1 in some cases. |
| Optimise VMware operational costs                 | {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_full_notm}} include several automation features that can help lower your operational costs. In the {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} offering, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} handles the configuration, capacity management, monitoring, patching, upgrades, and security of the underlying VMware infrastructure, through a highly available management plane. This can greatly reduce labor costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Additional tooling to right size on-premises x86   | Many business critical x86 environments which have an ecosystem of platforms including VMware, Bare Metal, and custom appliances can benefit from a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or FinOps review.

This analysis uses FinOps software from Akasia to compare the costs of running VMWare workloads on-premises and major cloud providers including {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Migration tooling                                 | The virtual machine migration method depends on the VMware on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} flavor, the size of the environment and the functionalities needed. When migrating to {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, the recommended method is to use VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA). VCDA enables migration from traditional on-premises VMware environments or from other {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} on IBM Cloud VMware Cloud Director environments. \n For all other VMware Cloud Foundation on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} flavors, the main options are VMware HCX, Zerto, Veeam, and PrimaryIO. VMware HCX allows to preserve the migrated virtual machines IP addresses, create easily reversible migration waves, and extend the network from on-premises to the cloud, which allows for progressive migrations. \n Zerto and Veeam are more traditional replication solutions and simpler to implement. PrimaryIO provides a DRaaS service that can also be used to migrate VMware workloads from on-premises to VCF on classic or on VPC in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} storage options                                           | The options for storage for VMware solutions on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} are {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} File storage (based on NFS, Network File Storage) VMware vSAN, or Block storage(iSCSI).  \n   \n VMware vSAN is based on an hyperconverged architecture where the storage of every compute node is aggregated into a single virtual storage pool. It supports advanced capabilities such as deduplication, encryption in transit, configurable resiliency level, and can be replicated across availability zones. vSAN software and 1 TiB per compute core of vSAN storage are included with every VCF license. Scaling up a vSAN cluster requires adding extra compute nodes. In the case of VCF on VPC, vSAN is the only available storage option.  \n IBM Cloud File Storage (NFS) and Block storage (iSCSI) offer scalable storage without having to scale the compute nodes. However, they do not have the same resiliency options, and can not be stretched across availability zones. Block storage (iSCSI) is only available for the VCF for Classic on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} offerings and requires additional manual configuration.  \n For secondary storage (not for the vSphere datastore), {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Object Storage can be used. It is best suited for unstructured data and long term or archival data storage.                                                                               |
| Backup and disaster recovery                                        | The available backup and disaster recovery methods depends on the VCF on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} flavor   \n   \n Regarding disaster recovery, for VCF as a Service on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} only, VMWare Cloud Director Availability (VCDA) is available and automatically provisioned with every VCF as a Service on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance. It allows to create a disaster recovery configuration between two VCF as a service instances or between a traditional on-premises VMware environment or another type of VCF on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instance and a VCF as a service instance. VMware Cloud Director Availability failover capabilities are bi-directional, allowing to failover from the primary site to the recovery site and subsequently to fall back from the recovery site to the primary site. Note that VMware Cloud Director Availability is the only supported disaster recovery solution for VMware as a Service as it is not possible to directly access the vCenter server. For more information, see [VCF as a Service overview](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmware-aas-overview&q=VCDA&tags=vmwaresolutions).  \n  For other VCF on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} flavors, other disaster recovery solutions are available.  \n  Zerto, Veeam, and ProtectIO are the main options. Zerto and Veeam are self managed solutions integrating directly with vCenter server to offer replication capabilities with configurable recovery points(up to a near 0 RPO with continuous replication). In the case of VCF for Classic - Automated on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, Veeam, and Zerto can be automatically deployed from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}VMware solutions portal. The configuration and operation of these solutions remains the responsibility of the customer. For more information, see [Veeam on VCF on IBM Cloud](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeamvm_overview) and [Zerto for VCF on IBM Cloud](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-addingzertodr).  \n  ProtectIO is a Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) offering from PrimaryIO that runs natively on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. ProtectIO also enables near zero Recovery Point Object (RPO) through continuous replication. Its agentless protection technique has no impact on the performance of the primary site. For more information, see [ProtectIO](https://www.primaryio.com/protectio/){: external}.  \n   \n Regarding backup, Veeam Backup and Replication is available for all VCF on IBM Cloud offerings. It is pre-installed with VCF as a Service on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} instances and can be automatically deployed with VCF for Classic - Automated, with different deployment types available such as VMware VM, VSI, and Bare Metal Server. Alternative 3rd party backup solutions can also be used, however, in the case of VCF as a Service on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, third-party backup solutions must be agent-based as it is not possible to directly access the vCenter server.
| Optimize VMware storage operational and capital costs               | When moving to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} VMware solutions operational expenses cost reductions can be achieved with vSAN through replacing or reducing manual tasks such as storage deployment, compliance configuration, scaling and capacity expansion with storage policies defined within VCF.

Using an MZR enables to achieve a higher level of availability and resiliency through the deployment of at least two VCF instances in two different availability zones. Note that if vSAN is used, cross availability zone replication is possible but requires a witness running in a third availability zone. The vSan witness can consist of a vSan witness appliance, which can be run on any VCF on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} host including on a {{site.data.keyword.vmware-service_short}} multitenant instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Provide secure connectivity between a customer remaining on-premise and VMware Cloud Foundation on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} | To securely connect from the remaining on-premises environment to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment, {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}} or VPN connectivity can be used. {{site.data.keyword.dl_full_notm}} is a high capacity private connection while VPN connectivity consists in an encrypted site-to-site or client-to-site tunnel over the public internet. On the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} side, the termination point for both options depends on the level of isolation required inside the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment and on the VCF deployment flavor. For more information, see [IBM Cloud Direct Link](/docs/dl?topic=dl-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl), [IBM Cloud VPNaaS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-overview) and [IBM CLoud Classic VPN options](/docs/iaas-vpn?topic=iaas-vpn-getting-started).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Provide secure and available access to web applications from the Internet                                      | To secure or filter traffic entering the environment, capabilities such as DDoS mitigation or web application firewall (WAF) should be considered. IBM Cloud Internet Services (CIS) includes these capabilities as well as the capability to act as a global load balancer (GLB), allowing to increase the availability and resiliency of the workloads running on VCF on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, provided that at least two different instances are deployed in at least two different availability zones. Alternatively, third party GLBs can also be used. For more information, see [IBM CIS](/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Firewall                                                                                                   | When migrating from on-premises to VCF on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, the firewall constructs available within the VMware environment remain unchanged, however particular attention should be given to the firewalling at the edge of the VMware environment. The recommended approach is to use a similar type of firewall appliance in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} as the one used on-premises to limit the operational changes, leverage the skills of existing operations team, and minimize the risk of disruption.  \n  Another point to consider is the firewall availability and resiliency requirements, especially in the case of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} VPC as the high availability modes that are supported will vary based on the firewall appliance type.  \n Several firewall virtual or physical options are available for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} VPC: Juniper vSRX, Fortinet vFSA, F5 Big-IP VE, Palo Alto VM-Series. everal firewall virtual or physical options are available for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Classic: Juniper vSRX, Fortinet FSA and vFSA, Vyatta Virtual Router Appliance. It is also possible to bring your own gateway as a virtual appliance on top of a dedicated {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Classic bare metal or as an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} VPC VSI deployed from a custom image. |
| Interconnectivity within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}                                                                         | To reach the various {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} from the VCF on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment, Virtual Private Endpoints (VPE), or Cloud Service Endpoints (CSE) can be used. VPEs are available for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} VPC VCF instances while CSEs are available for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Classic VCF instances. Both VPEs and CSEs allow to privately reach the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services, keeping the traffic within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and avoiding any egress traffic charges. For more information, see [IBM Cloud VPE](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe) and [IBM Cloud CSE](docs/account?topic=account-service-endpoints-overview)   \n  Integration of the different {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IaaS, such as VPC, classic and PowerVS, is achieved by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Transit Gateway, which is an as a service BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) router that can also be used as the termination point for direct link connectivity. IBM Cloud transit gateway can be local, limited to a specific region or global, spanning multiple regions.

| Adopting Zero trust          | Zero trust is a security strategy for cloud and hybrid cloud networks. It replaces the traditional security approach of network perimeter protection using firewalls and other security controls. With zero trust the operating principle is “never trust, always verify” moving the focus away from the network perimeter placing security around individual resources. Follow the principle of duty segregation using Role Based Access Control (RBAC). Segregation of duty ensures network, compute and storage administrators use separately defined RBACs. Use Access Groups to map the enterprise LDAP VMware administrators such as NSX or Cluster Admins to Access Groups.  \n  Developers do not have access to production.   \n  Implement the principle of least privilege by assigning only required access permissions.   \n  A time-based conditional access can be granted to limit access to timeframe you specify reducing opportunity for attack in the event of security breach.   \n  Access to and changes to resources including applications, compute, network, storage are secured, audited and verified.   \n  **References**   \n  [Best Practice for organising resources and assigning access](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup)   \n  [Enhance security by applying Context based restrictions](Enhance%20cloud%20security%20by%20applying%20context-based%20restrictions)   \n  [Protecting Virtual Private Cloud with Context based restrictions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-cbr&interface=ui)   \n  [Trusted profiles as foundation for secure cloud](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-trusted-profile-for-enterprise-security) |
| Single Sign On               | For over the past two decades, LDAP Directory Services have been the standard for the enterprise user identity provider (IdP). Review the ability to federate your corporate identity provider (IdP) with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM to allow your enterprise users access to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} with the company username and password SSO Single Sign On. Enterprise Federation (EF) is the authentication model that allows an enterprise’s IdP (Identity Provider) to authenticate users using their enterprise credentials to IBM Cloud leveraging IBMid. Once LDAP directory service federation is established between IBMid and the customer LDAP directory (or IdP) users from (SAML-based) LDAP attributes are evaluated at login and if they meet all of the conditions for a trusted profile, they are prompted to apply one or more trusted profiles. Trusted profiles grant users the level of access that they need to complete specialized and specific tasks in a limited time-period, for example, 1 - 4 hours.

## Migration Program
{: #migrationprogram}

The move of a business critical x86 VMware production platform to IBM Cloud is underpinned by the migration program which we propose to divide into 5 phases: Discovery, Assessment, MVP, Migration and Operate.

Discovery Phase1: Data is collected across technical, sales and business teams to understand the motivation and internal factors driving the move to Cloud. Identify priorities such as scalability, solving functional issues, lack of in-house skills, reducing infrastructure and IT expenses. Identify and document current infrastructure, applications, relationship, and dependencies including drift from the expected business required state. Key to data collection for the VMware on-premise or co-located platform is to a extraction tool such as RVtools.

Assessment Phase2: Data collected in the discovery phase is used to assess the migration to Cloud viability and choosing the right target platform solution. Prioritise the Lift and Shift migration of the VMWare SDDC to IBM Cloud VMware VCF so that current VMware ISV support, VMWare processes and automation is maintained. Avoid adding re-packaging (applications) or re-factor (to microservices) patterns to decouple the modernize from move to IBM Cloud program. Assess the supply-chain of workload validating utilisation and usage of VMware components. Right-size the target VCF landing zones consolidating VMware clusters making use of higher core density servers. Assess software supply chain and Data for the required encryption level and business key integration. The outcome of the assessment phase is a high-level architecture of the cloud environments with associated bill of materials.

Move to IBM Cloud Phased Approach ![Pattern overview.](images/migrationpicture.svg){: caption="Figure 5. VMware move to IBM Cloud phased migration approach" caption-side="bottom"}

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Phase3: Provides the confidence in the viability of the proposed solution. It is important to clearly define and articulate upfront the success criteria of the MVP as well as to identify the approving stakeholder(s). The successful MVP will build trust and confidence in the solution and provide the go ahead for the migration of the production workload. The MVP familiarise the operating team with the Cloud platform and guides towards a smooth adoption (transition).

Migration Phase4: Execution of workload (environment) migration. The duration of the migration to IBM Cloud phase is dependent on the complexity and criticality of the production environment. IBM Technology Expert Labs includes accelerator services to migrate workloads to IBM Cloud.

Operate (run) Phase5: Refers to tasks and processes to maintain the workload operational once the workload has been migrated to the target IBM Cloud VMware platform. Key processes include Backup, Observability (logging / monitoring) and maintaining compliance.

## Optimize x86 On-Premise into IBM Cloud
{: #optimisex86}

Typically the on-premise VMWare x86 virtualization platform is associated to a ecosystem of compute platforms such as bare metal x86 Windows or Linux servers hosting standalone or clustered applications. The move to cloud assessment can bring out additional business requirements linked to the full x86 ecosystem and proposed as follows:

Optimize x86 business requirements

- Provide Cloud native virtual instances deployable through Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and declarative language scripts such as Terraform.
- Enable AI inferencing in production business processes. Provide encoder decoder capabilities for developing GenAI business process innovation.
- Provide cost efficient, flexible and scalable, mission and business critical Kubernetes platform for modernized container cloud native applications.
- Provide alternative CPU platform to x86 for large enterprise workloads such as SAP or Oracle.
