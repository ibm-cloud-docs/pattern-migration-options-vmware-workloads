# VMware Lift and Shift to IBM Cloud White Paper
{: #whitepaper}

## Introduction
{: #introduction}

Over the past two decades, many enterprises have developed the VMware Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) as the dominant virtualization platform for hosting x86 production and business critical workloads in on-premise or co-located Data Center facilities. VMware has 44.8% market share in x86 virtualization platform technologies, per Statista.

In parallel with maintaining the production platform on-premise, and as a society outcome of the Global Covid pandemic, businesses have been requesting an acceleration of the digital transformation to a cloud native enterprise platform - in effect, a recognition that the compute platform has become the business, with hosted digital products generating the revenue. For the business, the digital compute platform needs to be trusted, highly available, secure, scalable, with agile integration to the digital products user experience and feature set evolution.

This whitepaper describes the business requirements, solution considerations and migration approaches to move the on-premise x86 VMware virtualization compute, storage and network to IBM Cloud VMware Solutions. The production workload environments (PROD, UAT, SIT, DEV), are moved to IBM Cloud VMware Solutions using the lift-and-shift method with no change to the business applications.


### On-Premise Business Challenges
{: #onpremisebusinesschallenges}

Business challenges are leading clients to re-evaluate the x86 VMware virtualisation on-premises or co-located platform:

-   Licensing cost increases for VMware virtualization: Businesses are looking to minimize the impact of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) bundled pricing changes effective 1 May 2024 and mitigate potential future VCF subscription cost increases. As part of their aquisition of VMware, Broadcom introduced a new unified subscription based licensing model for VMware software. This new model resulted in businesses needing to change their then perpetual VMware software licenses into two bundles: VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) or VMware vSphere Foundation Essential (VVF).

-   High operational costs to maintain on-premise or colocation datacenter facility:  Significant operating expenditure (OpEx) is incurred to maintain compliance and security of the VMware infratructure ressources across the x86 bare metal servers, storage and network devices. OpEx costs include:  \n
    -   Managing costly regulatory, industry certifications and audits.
    -   Time consuming server and VMware VCF component security patching updates

-   High Capital Expenditure (CapEx) costs to grow or adapt the on-premise facility to adapt to business requirements include:  \n
    -   Slow (multi-week) new VMware ESXi server provisioning for new capacity requirements
    -   Slow increased server memory (RAM) or additional storage request execution
    -   Shorter server refresh cycles to avoid costly extended warranties

-   Cybersecurity:  businesses are faced with growing cybersecurity threats and data breaches requiring their CISO to adopt the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity best practices and apply adequate preventative and recovery security measures to their systems. There are many challenges in deploying the zero-trust security model across hybrid cloud.

-   Deliver improved platform availability, resiliency, performance and scaling business requirements due to the accelerated shift to a digital economy. There has been a substantial increase in users working remotely from home, which started during the COVID-19 pandemic and has continued since. This hybrid work environment has led to an increased use of web-based and mobile applications. Business systems that once needed to be available 8 hours per day 5 days per week (8x5) now need to be available 24x7 with platform availability of 99.99%+. Cloud providers such as IBM can provide higher availability at lower costs than businesses can typically do on-premise.

-   Slow innovation and deployment of new modernized (cloud native) applications or services: initial application modernization to the cloud native operating system (Linux) and container platform (Kubernetes) was very successful for Web applications but has struggled particularly with modernization of Windows .Net Framework applications, leading to delayed application modernization (to cloud native) development programs

-   Delayed implementation of a datacenter exit business mandate.

-   Maintaining VMware automation assets while developing Infrastructure as Code assets across hybrid cloud platform.

### IBM Cloud VMware Solution Business Benefits
{: #ibmcloudbusinessbenefits}

Moving business critical VMware workload environments to IBM Cloud VMware Solutions enables the following benefits:

-   Enterprise-grade Cloud Infrastructure – leverages IBM Cloud robust and secure infrastructure designed to meet the stringent requirements of business critical workloads.

-   Flexibility – access to wide variety of hardware (chipsets) profiles including the latest Intel Xeon processors (currently 4th Gen.), access to VMware compute accelerators including smartNics, enabling higher virtual instance densification and higher CPU allocation to virtual servers. Scaling VMWare compute on IBM VMware offerings include the capability for new capacity expansion within the hour.

-   Opportunity to move VMware managed services and VMWare automation maintenance to IBM Cloud VMWare Cloud Foundation as a Service. A disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) is optional add-on.

-   Advanced Cloud Services – access to latest GPUs such as Nvidia and Intel for AI client solutions along with IBM Watsonx services GenAI, Inferencing and Machine Learning to fast track innovation into business processes. Additional performance benefits using latest Intel Sapphire Rapids accelerator features are possible for vSAN storage configured with Express Storage Architecture (ESA) using the CPU offloading capability.

-   Optimize x86 Workloads – in moving to IBM Cloud there is further opportunity to optimize the x86 workload to alternative IBM cloud enabled virtualization platforms such as KVM, Xen, PowerVM or LinuxOne on Z platform.

-   Cost savings – avoid unnecessary expenses associated with re-purchasing licenses for new infrastructure when adopting the new Broadcom / VMware VCF subscription. VMware Cloud Foundation on IBM Cloud allows businesses to address Broadcom Licensing immediately and generate a better near-term Return on Investment (ROI), which can then be redirected towards future re-hosting, re-platforming or application modernization to microservices initiatives.

| Retain VMware Virtualization                      | Retaining of VMware as the x86 virtualization platform allows for the same VMware components and operational skills and automation assets to be re-used in the IBM Cloud. No application changes are needed when moving to IBM Cloud via the lift-and-shift migration method for VMware clusters.\n \n Other options include: \\n \* Re-hosting to an alternate hypervisor such as KVM or HyperV which can require many risky application changes related to the infrastructure configuration such as IP addresses. Additionally, automation assets for the virtualised platform stack such as security patching for the hypervisor layer will need to be developed. \\n \* Re-platform the VMWare x86 virtual servers to KubeVirt containers which couples the move to Cloud with an application modernization program. This introduces risk of virtual instances remaining which can delay datacentre exit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Right Sizing VMware VCF License cores              | It is important to properly size the new server environment to minimize the cost of VMware licensing changes. Start with an RVTools report from the current on-premise VMware server environment. On-premise infrastructure is often sized to handle peak workloads. The report will show the number of vCPU, RAM and storage assigned to each virtual machine. For RAM and storage both the amount provisioned for the VM and the amount in use when the report was run will be displayed. The amount needed in the cloud should be closer to the in-use numbers. Consider the model numbers of the VMware ESXi servers on premise and note that the server models in IBM Cloud likely are newer, with significantly faster processors and more cores. Typically, fewer vCPU will be needed in the new environment which will lower VMware licensing cost. Cloud compute, memory and storage can be scaled rapidly so sizing can be aggressive initially in the cloud landing zone and scaled up as needed. Scaling or adding additional bare metal servers using the IBM VMware Cloud Foundation VPC or VCFaaS offerings can be done within an hour. Many VMware environments, such as development and test workloads, do not need to run all day long. It is recommended to shift non-production to hourly consumption on IBM Cloud VMware as a Service (VMWaaS) for 20-30% price decrease in assets and licenses. Many businesses are conservative when establishing a ratio of CPU to vCPU with ratios like 2:1 or 4:1 being common. With the more powerful Sapphire Rapids (Gen4) processors available on IBM Cloud, these ratios can be increased dramatically to 6:1 or even 12:1 in some cases. |
| Optimise VMware operational costs                 | VMWare on IBM Cloud offerings include several automation features that can help lower your operational costs. In the VMWare as a Service offering, IBM handles the configuration, capacity management, monitoring, patching, upgrades, and security of the underlying VMware infrastructure, through a highly available management plane. This can greatly reduce labor costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Additional tooling to right size on-premise x86   | Many business critical x86 environments which have an ecosystem of platforms including VMware, Bare Metal and custom appliances can benefit from a TCO or FinOps review. One IBM tool that can be leveraged to right-size your VMware environment is Turbonomic. Turbonomic employs a dynamic approach to rightsizing resources, assuring optimal performance while minimizing cost. Turbonomic can size your virtual machines’ vCPU and vMemory to match observed demand and peaks and can automate rightsizing in real time to meet demand. IBM also offers a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Analysis for businesses.

| Migration tooling                                 | The virtual machine migration method will depend on the VMware on IBM Cloud flavor, the size of the environment and the functionalities needed. When migrating to VMware VCF as a service on IBM Cloud, the recommended method is to use VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA). VCDA enables migration from traditional on premises VMware environments or from other VMware as a Service on IBM Cloud/VMware Cloud Director environments.\\n For all other VMware VCF on IBM Cloud flavors, the main options are VMware HCX, Zerto, Veeam and PrimaryIO. VMware HCX allows to preserve the migrated virtual machines IP addresses, create easily reversible migration waves and extend the network from on premises to the cloud (which allows for "progressive" migrations).\\n Zerto and Veeam are more traditional replication solutions, simpler to implement. PrimaryIO provides a DRaaS service that can also be used to migrate VMware workloads from on-premise to VCF on Classic or on VPC in IBM Cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| IBM Cloud Storage Options                                           | The options for storage for VMware solutions on IBM Cloud are IBM Cloud File (NFS), VMware vSAN or Block (iSCSI).<br><br>VMware vSAN is based on an hyperconverged architecture where the storage of every compute node is aggregated into a single virtual storage pool. It supports advanced capabilities such as deduplication, encryption in transit, configurable resiliency level and can be replicated across availability zones. vSAN software and 1 TiB per compute core of vSAN storage are included with every VCF license. Scaling up a vSAN cluster requires adding extra compute nodes. Note that in the case of VCF on VPC, vSAN is the only available storage option.<br>IBM File storage (NFS) and Block storage (iSCSI) offer scalable storage without having to scale the compute nodes. However, they do not have the same resiliency options, and can not be stretched across availability zones. Note that Block storage (iSCSI) is only available for the VCF for Classic on IBM Cloud offerings and requires additional manual configuration.<br>For secondary storage (not for the vSphere datastore), IBM Cloud Object Storage can be used. It is best suited for unstructured data and long term or archival data storage.                                                                               |
| Backup and Disaster Recovery                                        | The available backup and disaster recovery methods depends on the VCF on IBM Cloud flavor <br><br>Regarding Disaster recovery, for VCF as a Service on IBM Cloud only, VMWare Cloud Director Availability (VCDA)is available and automatically provisioned with every VCF as a Service on IBM Cloud instance. It allows to create a disaster recovery configuration between two VCF as a service instances (or between a traditional on premises VMware environment or another type of VCF on IBM Cloud instance and a VCF as a service instance).\\n For all other VMware VCF on IBM Cloud flavors ). VCDA failover capabilities are bi-directional, allowing to failover from the primary site to the recovery site and subsequently to fall back from the recovery site to the primary site. Note that VCDA is the only supported disaster recovery solution for VMware as a service as it is not possible to directly access the vCenter server. See [VCDA](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-vmware-aas-overview&q=VCDA&tags=vmwaresolutions) for more information.<br> For other VCF on IBM Cloud flavors, other disaster recovery solutions are available.<br> Zerto, Veeam and ProtectIO are the main options. Zerto and Veeam are self managed solutions integrating directly with vCenter server to offer replication capabilities with configurable recovery points (up to a near 0 RPO with continuous replication). In the case of VCF for Classic - Automated on IBM Cloud, Veeam and Zerto can be automatically deployed from the IBM Cloud VMware solutions portal (the configuration and operation of these solutions remains the responsibility of the customer). See [Veeam on VCF on IBM Cloud](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-veeamvm_overview) and [Zerto for VCF on IBM Cloud](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-addingzertodr) for more information on Veeam and Zerto.<br> ProtectIO is a Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) offering from PrimaryIO that runs natively on IBM Cloud. ProtectIO also enables near zero Recovery Point Object (RPO) through continuous replicationIts agentless protection technique has no impact on the performance of the primary site. See [ProtectIO](https://www.primaryio.com/protectio/){: external} for more information on the ProtectIO solution.<br><br>Regarding backup, Veeam Backup and Replication is available for all VCF on IBM Cloud offerings. It is pre-installed with VCF as a Service on IBM Cloud instances and can be automatically deployed with VCF for Classic - Automated, with different deployment types available (VMware VM, VSI, bare metal server...). Alternative 3rd party backup solutions can also be used, however note that in the case of VCF as a service on IBM Cloud, third-party backup solutions must be agent-based as it is not possible to directly access the vCenter server.
| Optimize VMware storage Operational and Capital costs               | When moving to IBM Cloud VMware solutions Operational expenses cost reductions can be achieved with vSAN through replacing or reducing manual tasks such as storage deployment, compliance configuration, scaling and capacity expansion with storage policies defined within VCF. When using NFS File Storage or Block storage from IBM Cloud storage administration and operations are by IBM Cloud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Choosing the IBM Cloud region                                                                              | Decide if the VCF instance will be deployed in a multi zone region (MZR) or in a single zone region (SZR). Using an MZR enables to achieve a higher level of availability/resiliency through the deployment of at least two VCF instances in two different availability zones. Note that if vSAN is used, cross availability zone replication is possible but requires a witness running in a third availability zone. The vSan witness can consist of a vSan witness appliance, which can be run on any VCF on IBM Cloud host (including on a VCF as a service multitenant instance).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Provide secure connectivity between customer remaining On-premise and VMware Cloud Foundation on IBM Cloud | To securely connect from the remaining on-premises environment to the IBM Cloud environment IBM Cloud Direct link or VPN connectivity can be used. IBM Cloud Direct link is a high capacity private connection while VPN connectivity consists in an encrypted site-to-site or client-to-site tunnel over the public internet. On the IBM Cloud side, the termination point for both options will depend on the level of isolation required inside the IBM Cloud environment and on the VCF deployment flavor. For more information regarding IBM Cloud Direct Link and VPN options see [IBM Cloud Direct Link](/docs/dl?topic=dl-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl), [IBM Cloud VPNaaS](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-overview) and [IBM CLoud Classic VPN options](/docs/iaas-vpn?topic=iaas-vpn-getting-started)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Provide secure and available access to Web applications from internet                                      | To secure or filter traffic entering the environment, capabilities such as DDoS mitigation or web application firewall (WAF) should be considered. IBM Cloud Internet Services (CIS) includes these capabilities as well as the capability to act as a global load balancer (GLB), allowing to increase the availability/resiliency of the workloads running on VCF on IBM Cloud, provided that at least two different instances are deployed in at least two different availability zones. Alternatively, third party GLBs can also be used. For more information on IBM Cloud Internet Services see [IBM CIS](/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Firewall                                                                                                   | When migrating from on premises to VCF on IBM Cloud, the firewall constructs available within the VMware environment remain unchanged, however particular attention should be given to the firewalling at the edge of the VMware environment. The recommended approach is to use a similar type of firewall appliance in IBM Cloud as the one used on-premises to limit the operational changes, leverage the skills of existing operations team and and, therefore, minimize the risk of disruption.<br> Another point to consider is the firewall availability/resiliency requirements, especially in the case of IBM Cloud VPC as the HA modes that are supported will vary based on the firewall appliance type.<br>Several firewall virtual or physical options are available for IBM Cloud VPC (Juniper vSRX, Fortinet vFSA, F5 Big-IP VE, Palo Alto VM-Series) and IBM Cloud Classic (Juniper vSRX, Fortinet FSA and vFSA, Vyatta Virtual Router Appliance). It is also possible to bring your own gateway (as a virtual appliance on top of a dedicated IBM Cloud Classic bare metal or as an IBM Cloud VPC VSI deployed from a custom image). |
| Interconnectivity within IBM Cloud                                                                         | IBM To reach the various IBM Cloud Services from the VCF on IBM Cloud environment, Virtual Private Endpoints (VPE) or Cloud Service Endpoints (CSE) can be used, depending on if the VCF on IBM Cloud instance is located in IBM Cloud Classic or in IBM Cloud VPC. Both VPEs and CSEs allow to privately reach the IBM Cloud services, keeping the traffic within IBM Cloud and avoiding any egress traffic charges. For more information on VPEs and CSEs, see [IBM Cloud VPE](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe) and [IBM Cloud CSE](docs/account?topic=account-service-endpoints-overview) <br> Integration of the different IBM Cloud IaaS (VPC, classic and PowerVS) is achieved by using the IBM Cloud Transit Gateway, which is a as a service BGP router that can also be used as the termination point for direct link connectivity. IBM Cloud transit gateway can be local, limited to a specific region or global, spanning multiple regions.

| Adopting Zero trust          | Zero trust is a security strategy for cloud and hybrid cloud networks. It replaces the traditional security approach of network perimeter protection using firewalls and other security controls. With zero trust the operating principle is “never trust, always verify” moving the focus away from the network perimeter placing security around individual resources. Follow the principle of duty segregation using Role Based Access Control (RBAC). Segregation of duty ensures network, compute and storage administrators use separately defined RBACs. Use Access Groups to map the enterprise LDAP VMware administrators such as NSX or Cluster Admins to Access Groups.\\n Developers do not have access to production. \\n Implement the principle of least privilege by assigning only required access permissions. \\n A time-based conditional access can be granted to limit access to timeframe you specify reducing opportunity for attack in the event of security breach. \\n Access to and changes to resources including applications, compute, network, storage are secured, audited and verified. \\n **References** \\n [Best Practice for organising resources and assigning access](/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup) \\n [Enhance security by applying Context based restrictions](Enhance%20cloud%20security%20by%20applying%20context-based%20restrictions) \\n [Protecting Virtual Private Cloud with Context based restrictions](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-cbr&interface=ui) \\n [Trusted profiles as foundation for secure cloud](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-trusted-profile-for-enterprise-security) |
| Single Sign On               | For over the past two decades, LDAP Directory Services have been the standard for the enterprise user identity provider (IdP). Review the ability to federate your corporate identity provider (IdP) with IBM Cloud IAM to allow your enterprise users access to IBM Cloud with the company username and password SSO Single Sign On. Enterprise Federation (EF) is the authentication model that allows an enterprise’s IdP (Identity Provider) to authenticate users using their enterprise credentials to IBM Cloud leveraging IBMid. Once LDAP directory service federation is established between IBMid and the customer LDAP directory (or IdP) users from (SAML-based) LDAP attributes are evaluated at login and if they meet all of the conditions for a trusted profile, they are prompted to apply one or more trusted profiles. Trusted profiles grant users the level of access that they need to complete specialized and specific tasks in a limited time-period, for example, 1 - 4 hours. Time-based access allows frequent authentication checks for reduced security risks.\\n**References** \\n[IBMid Enterprise Federation Introduction](/docs/en/ief?topic=introduction) \\n[How IBM Cloud IAM works](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview) \\n [Using Trusted profiles for IAM to IBM Cloud](/docs/account?topic=account-access-management-overview#trusted-profiles-iam) \\n [Enabling authentication from an external identity provider](/docs/account?topic=account-idp-integration) \\n                                                                                                                                                   |

## Migration Program
{: #migrationprogram}

The move of a business critical x86 VMware production platform to IBM Cloud is underpinned by the migration program which we propose to divide into 5 phases: Discovery, Assessment, MVP, Migration and Operate.

Discovery Phase1: Data is collected across technical, sales and business teams to understand the motivation and internal factors driving the move to Cloud. Identify priorities such as scalability, solving functional issues, lack of in-house skills, reducing infrastructure and IT expenses. Identify and document current infrastructure, applications, relationship, and dependencies including drift from the expected business required state. Key to data collection for the VMware on-premise or co-located platform is to a extraction tool such as RVtools.

Assessment Phase2: Data collected in the discovery phase is used to assess the migration to Cloud viability and choosing the right target platform solution. Prioritise the Lift and Shift migration of the VMWare SDDC to IBM Cloud VMware VCF so that current VMware ISV support, VMWare processes and automation is maintained. Avoid adding re-packaging (applications) or re-factor (to microservices) patterns to decouple the modernize from move to IBM Cloud program. Assess the supply-chain of workload validating utilisation and usage of VMware components. Right-size the target VCF landing zones consolidating VMware clusters making use of higher core density servers. Assess software supply chain and Data for the required encryption level and business key integration. The outcome of the assessment phase is a high-level architecture of the cloud environments with associated bill of materials.

Move to IBM Cloud Phased Approach ![Pattern overview.](migrationpicture.svg){: caption="Figure 5. Move to IBM Cloud Phased Approach" caption-side="bottom"}

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Phase3: Provides the confidence in the viability of the proposed solution. It is important to clearly define and articulate upfront the success criteria of the MVP as well as to identify the approving stakeholder(s). The successful MVP will build trust and confidence in the solution and provide the go ahead for the migration of the production workload. The MVP familiarise the operating team with the Cloud platform and guides towards a smooth adoption (transition).

Migration Phase4: Execution of workload (environment) migration. The duration of the migration to IBM Cloud phase is dependent on the complexity and criticality of the production environment. IBM Technology Expert Labs includes accelerator services to migrate workloads to IBM Cloud.

Operate (run) Phase5: Refers to tasks and processes to maintain the workload operational once the workload has been migrated to the target IBM Cloud VMware platform. Key processes include Backup, Observability (logging / monitoring) and maintaining compliance.

## Optimize x86 On-Premise into IBM Cloud
{: #optimisex86}

Typically the on-premise VMWare x86 virtualization platform is associated to a ecosystem of compute platforms such as bare metal x86 Windows or Linux servers hosting standalone or clustered applications. The move to cloud assessment can bring out additional business requirements linked to the full x86 ecosystem and proposed as follows:

Optimize x86 business requirements

-   Provide Cloud native virtual instances deployable through Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and declarative language scripts such as Terraform.
-   Enable AI inferencing in production business processes. Provide encoder decoder capabilities for developing GenAI business process innovation.
-   Provide cost efficient, flexible and scalable, mission and business critical Kubernetes platform for modernized container cloud native applications.
-   Provide alternative CPU platform to x86 for large enterprise workloads such as SAP or Oracle.
