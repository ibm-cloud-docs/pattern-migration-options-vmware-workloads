# Overview

{: \#overview}

For many enterprises, VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) is the virtualization platform for hosting production business critical distributed (x86-64) workloads in on-premises or in co-located Data Centre facilities.

VMware has 44.8% market share in virtualization platform technologies, per Statista and 79% of Enterprises across the globe runs VMware per IDC.

Business challenges are leading clients to re-evaluate the VMware (SDDC) on-premises or collocated platform:

-   Licensing cost increases for VMware virtualization: Businesses are looking to minimize the impact of VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) bundled pricing changes effective 1 May 2024 and mitigate potential future VCF subscription cost increases. Broadcom introduced a new unified licensing model for VMware software. This new model resulted in businesses needing to fit their current VMware software licenses mostly into one of two bundles: VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) or VMware vSphere Foundation (VVF).
-   High operational costs to maintain on-premises or colocation datacenter facilities: Maintaining compliance, security and growing capacity in on-premise datacenters can lead to significant capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) making release of funding for business innovation challenging.

    Maintaining compliance and security costs include

    -   Managing costly compliance (update certifications) and audits
    -   Shorter server refresh cycles to avoid costly extended warranty
    -   Time consuming Server and VMware VCF component security patching updates

        Growing on-premises capacity challenges include

    -   Slow (multi-week) new VMware ESX server provisioning for new capacity requirements
    -   Slow increased server memory (RAM) or additional storage request execution

        In addition, businesses faced with growing cybersecurity threads and data breaches are requiring their CISO to adopt the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity best practices and apply adequate preventative and recovery security measures to their systems. Challenges in deploying the zero trust security model across hybrid cloud.

-   Deliver improved platform availability, resiliency, performance and scaling business requirements due to the accelerated shift to a digital economy. There has been a substantial increase in users working remotely from home, which started during the COVID-19 pandemic and has continued since. This has led to an increased use of web-based and mobile applications. Due to this, business systems that once needed to be available 8 hours per day 5 days per week (8x5) now need to be available 24x7 with platform availability of 99.99%+. Cloud providers such as IBM can provide higher availability at lower costs than businesses can typically do on premise.
-   Slow innovation and deployment of new modernized (cloud native) applications or services: initial application modernization to the cloud native operating system (Linux) and container platform (Kubernetes) was very successful for Web applications but have struggled particularly with modernization of Windows .Net Framework applications, leading to delayed application modernization (to cloud native) development programs
-   Delayed implementation of a datacentre exit business mandate.
-   Maintaining VMware automation assets while developing Infrastructure as Code asset across hybrid cloud platform.

This whitepaper proposes to retain the VMware platform, leverage seamless migration standard tools (such as VMware HCX) to lift and shift the hosted business workloads (no application changes) into IBM Cloud VMware Solutions.

Moving business critical VMware workload environments to IBM Cloud VMware Solutions enables the following benefits:

-   Enterprise-grade Cloud Infrastructure – leverage IBM Cloud robust and secure infrastructure designed to meet the stringent requirements of business critical workloads.
-   Flexibility – access to wide variety of hardware (chipsets) profiles including latest Intel Xeon processors (currently 4th Gen.), access to VMware compute accelerators including network uplinks of 100 Gb/s, enabling higher virtual instance densification and CPU utilization. Scaling capacity on VPC offerings allow for new capacity within the hour.
-   Opportunity to move VMware managed services and VMWare automation asset maintenance to IBM Cloud VMWare Cloud Foundation as a Service (including DRaaS).
-   Advanced Cloud Services – access to latest GPUs such as Nvidia for AI client solutions along with IBM Watsonx services GenAI, Inferencing and Machine Learning to drive innovation into business processes.
-   Optimize Distributed Workload – in move to IBM Cloud there is further opportunity to optimize the x86-64 workload to alternative IBM cloud enabled virtualization platforms such as KVM, Xen, PowerVM.
-   Cost savings – avoid unnecessary expenses associated with re-purchasing licenses for new infrastructure when adopting the new Broadcom / VMware VCF subscription. VMware Cloud Foundation on IBM Cloud allows businesses to address Broadcom Licensing immediately and generate a better near-term ROI, which can then be redirected towards future re-hosting, re-platforming or application modernization to microservices initiatives.

| Retain VMware Virtualization                      | Retaining of VMware as the x86 virtualization platform allows for the same VMware components and operational skills and automation assets to be re-used in the IBM Cloud. No application changes are needed when moving to IBM Cloud via the lift and shift migration method for VMware clusters. \n Other options include: \n * Re-hosting to alternate hypervisor such as KVM or HyperV which can require a lot risky of application changes related to infrastructure configuration such as IP addresses. Additionally, automation assets for the virtualised platform stack such as security patching for the hypervisor layer will need to be developed. \n * Re-platform the VMWare x86 virtual servers to KubeVirt containers which couples the move to Cloud with an application modernization program. This introduces risk of virtual instances remaining which can delay datacentre exit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Choosing IBM Cloud® for VMware Solutions offering | The choice to move on remise VMware workloads to IBM Cloud for VMware allows businesses to retain same VMware design, management plane and automation currently used on premise. The move to the latest compute (Gen4), storage vSAN and network (100 Gbps)platforms can help improve application performance and lower VMware licensing costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Right Sizing VMware VCF License core              | It is important to properly size the new server environment to minimize the cost of VMware licensing changes. Start with an RVTools report from the current on premise VMware server environment. On premise infrastructure is often sized to handle peak workloads. The report will show the number of vCPU, RAM and storage assigned to each virtual machine. For RAM & storage both the amount provisioned for the VM and the amount in use when the report was run will be displayed. The amount needed in the cloud should be closer to the in-use numbers. Consider the model numbers of the VMware ESXi servers on premise and note that the server models in IBM Cloud likely are newer, with significantly faster processors and more cores. Typically, fewer vCPU will be needed in the new environment which will lower VMware licensing cost. Cloud compute, memory and storage can be scaled rapidly so sizing can be aggressive initially in the cloud landing zone and scaled up as needed. Scaling or adding additional bare metal servers using the IBM VMware Cloud Foundation VPC or VCFaaS offerings can be done within an hour. Many VMware environments, such as development and test workloads, do not need to run all day long. It is recommended to shift non-production to hourly consumption on IBM Cloud VMware as a Service (VMWaaS) for 20-30% price decrease in assets and licenses. Many businesses are conservative when establishing a ratio of CPU to vCPU with ratios like 2:1 or 4:1 common. With the more powerful Sapphire Rapids (Gen4) processors available on IBM Cloud, these ratios can be increased dramatically to 6:1 or even 12:1 in some cases. |
| Optimise VMware operational costs                 | VMWare  on IBM Cloud offerings include several automation features that can help lower your operational costs. In the VMWare as a Service offering, IBM handles the configuration, capacity management, monitoring, patching, upgrades, and security of the underlying VMware infrastructure, through a highly available management plane. This can greatly reduce labor costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Additional tooling to right size on-premise x86   | Many business critical x86 environments which have an ecosystem of platforms including VMware, Bare Metal, custom appliances can benefit from a TCO or FinOps review. One IBM tool that can be leveraged to right-size your VMware environment is Turbonomic. Turbonomic employs a dynamic approach to rightsizing resources, assuring optimal performance while minimizing cost.

| Migration tooling                                 | The virtual machine migration method will depend on the VMware on IBM Cloud flavour, the size of the environment and the functionallities needed. When migrating to VMware VCF as a service on IBM Cloud,the recommended method is to use VMware Cloud Director Availability (VCDA). VCDA enables migration from traditional on premises VMware environments or from other VMware as a Service on IBM Cloud/VMware Cloud Director environments.\n For all other VMware VCF on IBM Cloud flavours, the main options are VMware HCX, Zerto, Veeam and PrimaryIO. VMware HCX allows to preserve the migrated virtual machines IP addresses, creating easily reversible migration waves and extending the network from on premises to the cloud (which allows for "progressive" migrations).\n Zerto and Veeam are more traditional replication solutions, simpler to implement. PrimaryIO provides a DRaaS service that can also be used to migrate VMware workloads from on premise to VCF on Classic or on VPC in IBM Cloud.|
