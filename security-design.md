| Adopting Zero trust          | Follow the principle of duty segregation using Role based access control (RBAC). Segregation of duty ensures network, compute and storage administrators use separately defined RBACs. Additionally, Developers do not have access to production. \\n Implement principle of least privilege by assigning only required access permissions. A time-based conditional access can be granted to limit access to timeframe you specify reducing opportunity for attack in the event of security breach. Access to and changes to resources including applications, compute, network, storage are secured, audited and verified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Single Sign On               | LDAP Directory Services has been the standard for the enterprise user identity provider (IdP). Review the ability to federate your corporate identity provider (IdP) with IBM Cloud IAM to allow your enterprise users access to IBM Cloud with the company username and password SSO Single Sign On.  Enterprise Federation (EF) is the authentication model that allows an enterpriseâ€™s IdP (Identity Provider) to authenticate users using their enterprise credentials to IBM Cloud leveraging IBMid. Once LDAP directory service federation is established between IBMiD and the customer LDAP directory (or IdP) users from (SAML-based) LDAP attributes are evaluated at login and if they meet all of the conditions for a trusted profile, they are prompted to apply one or more trusted profiles. Trusted profiles grant users the level of access that they need to complete specialized and specific tasks in a limited time-period, for example, 1 - 4 hours. Time-based access allows frequent authentication checks for reduced security risks. /nReferences /n[IBMid Enterprise Federation Introduction](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ief?topic=introduction) /n[How IBM Cloud IAM works](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview) /n[Using Trusted profiles for IAM to IBM Cloud](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-access-management-overview#trusted-profiles-iam) |
